# Parking-Lot-Vacancy-Detector
Grad project for Computer Vision course(Spring 18)

Short Description:

1. Created a training dataset from Ground Truth(.xml) ﬁle , then trained the cascade classiﬁer using the feature types HAAR and LBP. Used the classiﬁer to detect cars in a test image and to decide if a parking spot is empty. 
2. Utilized a dataset of 184K positive images and 150K negative images and trained different models based on number of stages and feature types. 
3. Achieved an overall(Avg) accuracy of 90% by ﬁnding true positives, false positives, true negatives and false negatives.
